                         target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header" id="terms_conditions" name="terms_conditions">Terms and
    conditions</h2>

<p>Our terms and conditions were last updated on 29 May 2014.</p>

                    title="blinkbox books">www.blinkboxbooks.com</a>, is operated by blinkbox books

    out in <a href="#section11">Section 11</a>.</p>

<p>By using our website (via our app or otherwise), and each time you buy an eBook, you agree to
    these terms. Please also read our <a href="#privacy_and_cookies">Privacy and Cookies Policy</a>,
    which sets out how we will collect, process and use your information. If you don’t agree to any
    of these terms or our privacy policy, we’d kindly ask that you don’t use our website.</p>

<p>We will update our terms from time to time and the latest version will appear on our website with
    the date that it was updated. By using the service after any changes have been posted, you agree
    to the new terms.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section1" name="section1"></a>1. Your account

        us</a>.</p>


<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section2" name="section2"></a>2. Accessing our
    website and the eBooks</h2>

<p>To read eBooks on your device you will first need to download our free app to your device (see
    our <a href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/home" target="_blank">help pages</a> for how to
    do this). Although we are working to ensure that our service is compatible across devices, we
    cannot guarantee that our service will work with all devices. Please, therefore, check that your
    device is compatible with the service before you buy any eBooks. You can do this by installing
    our free app on your device and trying to download a free eBook or a free sample. If you have
    any questions or any problems checking your device compatibility, please have a look at our <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/home" target="_blank">help pages</a> or <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact
        us</a>. Please note that our services include elements which allow our software to be
    downloaded on to your computer or devices and interact with other programs or equipment.</p>

<p>Each eBook in your account can only be downloaded to and stored on a maximum of 5 authorised
    devices that you register with your account.</p>

<p>We will do our best to make sure that our website and services are uninterrupted and that our
    website and content are error free, although we can’t guarantee this. If we need to suspend or
    restrict access to, or update, our service or content, we will do our best to minimise any
    disruption to you.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section3" name="section3"></a>3. Content on the
    website</h2>

<p>We may change or remove content or parts of our website.</p>

<p>The legal rights (including the intellectual property rights) in our website, any content on it
    (including the eBooks) and the compilation of this content is owned by us, or licensed to us by
    third parties. Our website and content, including the compilation of the content, is protected
    by international copyright laws and database rights.</p>

<p>Where we provide links from our website to other sites, this will be for information purposes
    only. We have no control over, or responsibility for, the content on those sites or
    resources.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section4" name="section4"></a>4. Your use of the
    website and the eBooks</h2>

<p>Please do not share eBooks on peer-to-peer networks or other file sharing networks or websites.
    We’re happy for you to use the content on our website and the eBooks you buy for your own
    personal use in accordance with these terms and provided that you do not remove any copyright
    notices. You may not use our trade marks, logos or other intellectual property and you may not
    use the eBooks you purchase or any other content on our website for any commercial, promotional,
    institutional, corporate or teaching purposes.</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t copy, publish or otherwise seek to exploit our website or our content or use
    our service for any illegal purpose or in any way that causes damage to our website, is harmful
    to other users or which interferes with the copyright protection technology we use.</p>

<p>We will take the action we think is necessary to protect our service and our customers (which may
    include us suspending or restricting your account and access to our service).</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section5" name="section5"></a>5. Placing an
    order</h2>

<p>Some eBooks and samples are available for free and will be clearly labelled on the service.
    Whilst samples will be available without signing into an account, for access to our free eBooks
    you will need to set up and sign in to your account and click on the appropriate “Buy now”
    button. You will then be asked whether you want to Cancel order or Confirm order. If you confirm
    your order, the free eBook will be added to your digital library and we will send you an email
    confirming that it is available. For more information about how to access samples and free
    eBooks, please see our <a href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/home" target="_blank">help
        pages</a>.</p>

<p>In order to purchase an eBook, you will need to sign in to your account and click on the “Buy
    now” button next to the eBook. You will then be asked to submit your payment details in
    accordance with our accepted payment methods. Our order process allows you to check and amend
    any errors before submitting your order. Please note that once you click on the “Confirm and
    pay” button, we will process your payment details and you will not be able to cancel your order.
    When you place an order you will be able to choose whether you want to store your payment
    details so that you don’t have to re-enter them each time you buy an eBook. For more information
    on how to store your payment details and how to buy eBooks, please see our <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/home" target="_blank">help pages</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section6" name="section6"></a>6. Availability,
    prices and payment</h2>

<p>The availability and prices of our eBooks may change from time to time. Any changes to the prices
    will not affect any order that we have confirmed. We do our best to make sure that availability
    and pricing are correct, but, if we make a mistake and can’t supply you with an eBook, we will
    let you know via email and we won’t process your order.</p>

<p>Once you have placed your order in accordance with <a href="#section5">Section 5</a>, we will
    take payment from your provided payment method. All credit/debit card holders are subject to
    validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to
    authorise payment we can&rsquo;t accept your order. We are not responsible for your card issuer
    or bank charging you as a result of our processing of your credit/debit card payment in
    accordance with your order.</p>

<p>After you have submitted your order, it has been accepted by us and payment has been received,
    you will receive an e-mail confirming the details of your order and your eBook will be
    automatically delivered to your account. The contract between us and you for the purchase of the
    eBook will only be formed once we confirm that your payment has been processed.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section7" name="section7"></a>7. Your right to
    cancel the contract</h2>

<p>If you purchase an eBook by mistake, please <a
        href="http://blinkbox.me/cformbooks">contact
    us</a> as soon as possible to request a refund. If you let us know within a reasonable period of
    time and provided that you have not downloaded or started reading the eBook, we will do our best
    to refund you the purchase price, subject to any restrictions imposed on us by our content
    suppliers.</p>

<p>This does not affect your legal rights, including if the eBooks are faulty or are not as
    described, please see <a href="#section8">Section 8</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section8" name="section8"></a>8. What happens if
    it goes wrong: replacements and refunds</h2>

<p>If your eBook has not appeared in your account after we have confirmed your purchase, please
    check the <a href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/home" target="_blank">help pages</a> or <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact
        us</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Please <a href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact
    us</a> if your eBook appears to be faulty. We will check your copy and if it is faulty, offer
    you a replacement or a refund.</p>

<p>Please note that we are not responsible for any lack of functionality or failure to provide any
    of the website, or content on the website or any loss of content or data that is due to your
    equipment, devices or Internet connection.</p>

<p>These terms do not affect your legal rights. For more information about your legal rights in
    relation to any eBooks purchased that are faulty or are not as described, you may wish to visit
    your local Citizens Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section9" name="section9"></a>9. Our legal
    obligations</h2>

<p>If we don&rsquo;t comply with our obligations to you under these terms or are negligent in
    providing the services to you, we are responsible for any loss or damage that you suffer that
    was a &ldquo;foreseeable result&rdquo; of such breach or negligence. Loss or damage is a
    foreseeable result if it is an obvious consequence of our failure to comply with these terms or
    if it was contemplated by us and you at the time we entered into the contract.</p>

<p>We only supply the eBooks for your domestic and private use. You agree not to use the eBooks for
    any commercial, business or re-sale purposes and we have no liability to you for any loss of
    profit, loss of business, business interruption or loss of business opportunity.</p>

<p>Nothing in these terms limits or excludes our liability for: (i) death or personal injury caused
    by our negligence; (ii) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (iii) any other liability that cannot
    be excluded by law.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a id="section10" name="section10"></a>10. Other
    important terms</h2>

<p>This contract is between you and us. No other person has any rights to enforce any of its
    terms.</p>

<p>You may not transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to anyone else without our
    written permission. We may transfer our rights and obligations to another organisation, but this
    will not affect your rights or our obligations to you under these terms.</p>

<p>Each of the paragraphs in these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority
    decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in
    full force and effect.</p>

<p>These terms, and any contract between us, are in the English language. Your use of the service
    and any eBooks purchased via the service, including any dispute or claim arising out of or in
    connection with it, will be governed by English law. We and you both agree that the courts of
    England and Wales shall have the non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are resident in
    Northern Ireland, you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident
    in Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.</p>

</ul>

<p>We may supplement the information we collect about you with information we receive from other
    sources, for example, public registers such as the electoral roll. This allows us to assess the
    accuracy of the information we hold about you in order to send you relevant offers and
    information.</p>

<h3>Using the website</h3>

<p>When using our website (whether via our app or otherwise), our servers may keep an activity log
    unique to you that collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP
    address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash
    reports and type of browser used. Whenever you sign in, we may associate that information with
    your account.</p>

<h3>User accounts</h3>

<p>To use certain functions on the service you need to register for an account. When you register
    your account you need to submit personal information, including your real name, email address
    and a password. Your password is used to protect your account from unauthorised access. It
    should be at least 6 characters long, and we recommend using a mix of upper and lower case
    letters, numbers, and symbol. The longer your password is, the stronger it will be. You should
    never share your password. If you think that your password has been compromised, please <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact
        us</a>.</p>

<h3>Clubcard information</h3>

<p>To earn and, if available, redeem, ‘Tesco Clubcard’ loyalty points when you buy an eBook please
    enter your ‘Tesco Clubcard’ number in your account details.</p>

<p>We may access the information recorded through the use of your Clubcard (and combine the same
    with any other personal information of yours that we collect under this policy or that is held
    by the Tesco Group under its ‘Tesco Clubcard’ loyalty scheme and which they are allowed to share
    with us) in order to help us improve our service to you and make our communications more
    relevant.</p>

<h3>Purchasing eBooks</h3>

<p>When buying an eBook on the service we will ask you for such further information as is necessary
    to complete the purchase, including your payment card details and billing address. You will have
    the option to store payment and billing information in your account to make the process quicker
    next time.</p>

<p>We collect all data relating to any transaction you make on the service, including information
    about the books you purchase and the price you paid. We also collect information about your
    usage such as when and how often you use our service.</p>

<h3>Communications with us</h3>

<p>When you have registered, you can choose to turn your marketing preferences off or on. To change
    your contact preferences, choose “Personal details” from your account drop-down and scroll down
    to “Your marketing preferences”. If you do not want to receive commercial communications from
    us, unstick this box.</p>

<p>When you contact us or submit feedback, we also record that information.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a name="pac_section2" id="pac_section2"></a>2. How we
    collect your personal information</h2>

<p>Unless this policy or the law says otherwise, we will only collect your personal information with
    your knowledge and consent. Consent can be given in a number of ways such as ticking or
    un-ticking a box, by email, by telephone or by your actions (such as your use of a product or
    service). You may withdraw your consent at any time, unless the law provides otherwise. Where
    you withdraw your consent, we will tell you about the impact of doing so and any such withdrawal
    will take effect only in relation to the way we collect, use or disclose your personal
    information in the future.</p>

<p>Our website also uses cookies. In order to comply with new rules, we use a system of classifying
    the different types of cookies which we use on the website, or which may be dropped by third
    parties through our website. The classification was developed by the International Chamber of
    Commerce UK and explains more about which cookies we use, why we use them, and the functionality
    you will lose if you decide you don't want to have them on your device. Please be reassured that
    we are working on other privacy and cookie-related improvements to the service.</p>

<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>

<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your
    personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back
    to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that
    cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device.</p>


<p><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> - these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of
    time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that
    created that particular cookie.</p>

<p><strong>Session cookies</strong> - these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a
    user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and
    finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you
    close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>

<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently,
    remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to
    ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

<p>You can find more information about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"
                                                     target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and
    <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>


<h3>Cookies used on the website</h3>

<p>A list of all the cookies used on the website by category is set out below.</p>

<p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong></p>

<p><strong>These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for. For those types of cookies
    that are strictly necessary, no consent is required.</strong></p>

<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its
    features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have
    asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</p>


<p><strong>Performance cookies</strong></p>

<p><strong>These cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited. By using the website,
    you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.</strong></p>

<p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use the website, for instance which pages
    visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't
    collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is
    aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the website works.</p>


<p><strong>Functionality cookies</strong></p>

<p><strong>These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. By using the website,
    you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.</strong></p>

<p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or
    the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be
    used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you
    can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a
    video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they
    cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>

<p><strong>Targeting or advertising cookies</strong></p>

<p><strong>These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising
    relevant to you and your interests.</strong></p>

<p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also
    used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
    effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with
    our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared
    with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will
    be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>

<p><strong>Behavioural advertising and online privacy</strong></p>

<p>A guide to behavioural advertising and online privacy has been produced by the internet
    advertising industry which can be found at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/"
                                                  target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. The
    guide contains an explanation of the IAB's self-regulatory scheme to allow you greater control
    of the advertising you see.</p>

<p><strong>Using browser settings to manage cookies</strong></p>

<p>The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
    accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how
    to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser
    add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its
    manufacturer.</p>

<p>However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the website's essential features,

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a name="pac_section3" id="pac_section3"></a>3. How we
    use your personal information</h2>

<p>The main reason we collect and use your personal information is to provide you with our service
    (as described in the <a href="#terms_conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>). Collecting your

    and use your personal information in order to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>manage and improve the website and our service;</li>
    <li>personalise our service to you;</li>
    <li>administer and operate your account;</li>
    <li>process your orders and allocate Clubcard points to your account;</li>
    <li>provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel
        may interest you (where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes);
    </li>
    <li>provide user support, process any complaints or enquiries made by you and to tell you about
        important changes to the service and our website;
    </li>
    <li>provide sales reports to our content suppliers;</li>

</ul>

<p>We may share your personal information with other members of Tesco Group to enable us to provide
    our service to you or so they can to provide you with relevant products or services. For further
    details, please read <a href="#pac_section4">Section 4</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a name="pac_section4" id="pac_section4"></a>4.
    Marketing, research and sharing your information with third parties</h2>

<p>If you agree, we may contact you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>with offers and information about our products and services;</li>
    <li>with offers and information about partners’ products or services;</li>
    <li>for customer research.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the choice is entirely yours but if you say you do not want to receive marketing
    information from us this will prevent you from receiving great offers or promotions that may be
    of interest to you.</p>

<p>Where you have chosen to receive promotional and marketing information, we may also use your
    personal information (including your email address) to provide you with information regarding
    any products, services and promotions offered by us, members of the Tesco Group and trusted
    third parties that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, or pass on your details for
    marketing purposes to members of the Tesco Group, please <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact
        us</a> or amend your communication preferences, see our <a
            href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/home" target="_blank">help pages</a> for how to
    do this.</p>

<p> We may use and share anonymised information about you and your use of our service with the Tesco
    Group and to third parties, including with our content suppliers. Please be reassured that this
    never includes your personal information. You consent to us anonymising your personal
    information so that it does not identify you to those third parties.</p>

<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, for example
    analysing data, providing marketing assistance, fulfilling orders and processing and storing
    credit card details. They have access to personal information required to perform their
    functions, but are not permitted to use it for other purposes. They must process the personal
    information in accordance with this policy, and must adhere to all applicable laws.</p>

<p>Other members of the Tesco Group and third parties with whom we may share your personal
    information under this policy may be located outside the European Economic Area in countries
    whose laws offer a lower degree of protection for your personal information than in the UK. We
    will, nonetheless, use appropriate means to ensure that those members of the Tesco Group and
    third parties abide by this policy and the UK and EU’s laws on data protection.</p>

<p>Your personal information is safe with us and will never be released to companies outside the
    Tesco Group for marketing purposes. Unless set out above, we will never disclose your
    information to anyone outside the Tesco Group except where we have your consent, where we are
    required or permitted to do so by law, or where we need to disclose it to any prospective or
    actual buyer of our business or assets.</p>

<p>We will only store your information as long as is necessary for these purposes or as required by
    law.</p>

<h2 class="section_header underlined_header"><a name="pac_section5" id="pac_section5"></a>5.

    purposes for which it is used.</p>

    Security</h2>

<p>We are responsible for personal information under our control. When we use trusted third parties,
    including members of the Tesco Group, to provide part of the service, such as fulfilling orders,
    processing credit card payments or providing customer service, we put in place appropriate
    measures to make sure they also comply with this policy and all applicable privacy laws.</p>

<p>When visiting our website, using our apps or buying or accessing our eBooks and other services,
    your personal data is held by us on secure servers based in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>We will protect your personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity
    of the information, including physical measures (e.g. locked filing cabinets, restricted access,
    secure disposal of personal information), organisational measures (e.g. security clearances,
    limiting access only on a “need to know” basis) and technological (e.g. use of passwords and
    encryption).</p>

<p>For any additional information about the security measures we employ please <a
        href="https://support.blinkboxbooks.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact
    us</a>.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to confirm your identity, age, the
    registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the service for potential breach of
    the <a href="#terms_conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
